## Purpose

The system of roads in the Roman State represented complex network of stone paved roads connecting Rome with all parts of the Empire, stretching all accross the Mediterranean with more of 50,000 miles of known paved roads. The roads were crutial infrastructure enabling fast movement of Roman armies, information circulation and state related traffic. However, roads and the related amenities were used also by the local inhabitans for transport of goods and people. The inscriptions were often placed next to the course of the road (milestones, funerary inscriptions) to convey imporatant information to the traveller. Moreover, the text of inscriptions contained details of road building, maintenance, physical description of the amenities, such as inns or horse-stations, bridges, gates, and the daily use of the road. 

This project aims to to extract information related the road system and its use in the ancient Mediterranean on the basis of surviving Latin, and potentially also Greek, inscriptions.  


### Project 1 - Milestones

Milestone is a specific type of inscription on stone that was placed next to the road so the travellers could orientate themselves in the space. Milestones usually contained information on who built or paid for the reconstruction of the road, who was responsible for the maintenance and to the administrative region of which city the road belonged. The distances were usually stated in Roman miles with the typical formula 'milia passuum' (literally: thousand steps). 

The location (geocoordinates) of milestones can help determine the course of the road, its date, and the spatial extent of the administrative units (cities in charge, so called 'caput viae'). However, not all milestones were categorised systematically and the set of rules 'what defines a milestone' is often vague and based on small samples from geographically limited regions.

The purpose of the Project 1 is to find a subset of all milestones in the EDH dataset and on the basis of the subset determine a set of rules for future epigraphers to help them classify an inscription as a milestone. 

The set of rules will ideally contain: 

1. the most common words occuring in a milestone
1. most common material
1. typical range of physical dimensions etc.

FUTURE STEPS: The example of a milestone inscription will be later expanded to all types of inscriptions in order to create a handbook for epigraphers, see subproject 1.

#### Subproject 1 - classification of inscriptions

Train a classification model (based on the data + metadata available through EDH dataset, 80,000+ records) to help classify an input dataset.

Training dataset - use attributes (sorted from the most important):
1. `clean_text_interpretive_word` = containing clean text of an inscription, text
2. `type_of_inscription_clean` = containing cleaned typology for inscriptions, 22 unique categories
3. `type_of_inscription_certainty` = containg binary values (certain, uncertain) stating the level of confidence of the classification in `type_of_inscription_clean` 
4. `material_clean` = cleaned material of the inscribed object, 34 unique categories
5. `type_of_monument_clean` = cleaned typology of types of inscribed objects
6. `type_of_monument_certainty` = containg binary values (certain, uncertain) stating the level of confidence of the classification in `type_of_monument_clean`

Additional attributes that can be used to improve the classification:

1. `height_cm` = cleaned maximal height of the object
2. `width_cm` = cleaned maximal width of the object
3. `depth_cm` = cleaned maximal depth of the object

The input dataset has no formal typology, it contains the following attributes (link to the dataset TBA)
1. `clean_text_interpretive_word` = containing clean text of an inscription
2. `material` = cleaned material of the inscribed object

*Scenario:* 
Based on the training dataset generate a classification model that would help researchers classify inscritpions in an input dataset. 

Ideal outcome of the model - numeric representation of a probability with which an inscription X from the input dataset falls into the categorisation of inscription types. For example, `inscription X from input dataset is categorised as 56 % milestone,  45 % decree,  10 % funerary inscription, 1 % list.`

### Project 2 - Road use on inscriptions

According to a widely accepted theory, inscriptions were clustered along the roads or in their proximity. Their contents were often communicating with the travellers, evidenced by the frequent use of invocations for travellers such as 'viator' or 'parodita' in the text of inscriptions. Other inscriptions mention the traffic on the roads and their use by the army or by the local communities as well. 

I have created a set of Latin vocabularies related to the use of roads, their construction and physical ammenities connected with the road traffic. I will search for the occurences of these terms in the text of the inscription in order to create a subset of inscriptions related to a road use.

I will then assess the usefulness of the method by spotchecking the text of inscriptions and the relevance of their text to the use of the road system. I will reevaluate the list of the vocabularies based on the findings.

I will analyse the frequency of topics occuring on the road related inscriptions, e.g. commercial or military traffic on the roads, individual travellers, physical ammenities, building activities etc. and compare them over space and time (by Roman Provinces, by centuries).

As a next step, I will overlay the subset of isncriptions with the known datasets of the Roman roads (e.g. Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman world, Pleaides) in order to detect any spatial clusters of inscriptions away from the course of known roads. This was a new (undiscovered) Roman roads could be detected, but also the relation between roads and spatial dispositions of inscriptions can be verified.
